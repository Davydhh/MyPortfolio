  my_story: |
    Hello, my name is Davide and I was born in Italy in 1998. Since I was a child I have always been passionate about technology, a passion so strong that it drove me to complete a 5-year university degree and then turn my passion into a job. 
    I love learning new things to improve my skills. 

    For me, Informatics means creativity and limitlessness, you can create anything, the only limit is our mind.
